I rolled over on my back, put my head on my pillow looked out the Glass french style door looking up and over the tree line and into the sky. I thought to myself \"What is that!\" I have seen objects in the sky before when I was in the U.S. Navy but back then we didn't have accessible video cameras to capture what I was seeing. I jumped out of bed, because I knew this was something that no one would believe, went to grab my cell phone which was in the kitchen on the opposite end of the house to use the video option on it. I had to wait for my phone to boot up and turn on. As I was waiting, I went out onto the back patio to get a better vantage of the object. It was approximately 400-500 hundred feet up and was shaped like a capital letter \"T\". I would say it was the size of a school bus. It was red in color and didn't blink but rather pulsated from bright dark red to a light color of pink. I would say it pulsated every 10 seconds. It was moving from the North West to the South East slowly. across the back of my house which faces North. At one point it was going over the trees to the side of my house which was East. I looked down at my phone and it was on at this point and I went through the house to get to the front yard on the south side of my property. I looked through the tall trees and could see the light but was to late in getting either a video or a picture of it. My house in in the middle of my property of 10 wooded acres which is very dark at night and made it very easy to see the object. I was so in awe of what I was seeing that I actually forgot that I was holding my phone. Also, there was NO sound coming from it at all. Not sure what good it will do to report this sighting because I have no \"Proof\" but, I know what I saw!","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":["https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/Screenshot-2022-04-22-103525-2aa1681b3aa7abd6df060ef49eb388ef.png"]},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167579.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Straight line of lights in formation\n\nA straight line of lights which at first I thought might be some kind of meteor until I stared at it and my eyes acclimated to the darkness.

I said thanks for the ride and started up my driveway going west, dead west... I then looked up at the giant maple in our backyard cause it's diseased and going to fall soon, at that point I noticed a weird shaped object, I thought mabey a cloud but it was very long and thin...it was long in an up and down way...like longitudinal....with a very defined shape....not like a cloud which have mostly soft edges..Its a beautiful night tonight , only a few clouds here and there. And because I live in Akron I then assumed that this bizarre shaped cloud was the goodyear blimp because at this time it had moved, it was moving. And then there was several lights in a row along the long part of the object. They didn't appear all of a sudden...they sorta faded into view. At this point I was sure it was the blimp....so I waited to hear the sound of the engines. There was no sound. The object was moving in a east by south east direction. I have no idea of altitude but. It appeared to be about as high as the (few) clouds there was in the sky. So at this point I'm like wtf...I pull out my phone (samsung galaxy note 20 ultra) which has a great low light camera to get a better look. I was able to get it in the screen and observe the object for about 6 seconds. OF COURSE I DIDNT GET A PIC OR VIDEO, but I did see that it definitely was cigar shaped and the lights that I had only seen about 8-10 of now appeared to be more like a lcd ticker display. I mean that it appeared to be a grid of lights...I think they were somewhat strobing....they were all white (about 5000k temp) . So at this point I was totally like 'whoa' there was still no sound then while I was watching it appeared to go behind a cloud...but there was no cloud. The object moved from about a 2 o'clock position to about a 12 o'clock position if I was facing south....lastly while I was observing whateber....I noticed a jet or plane that was much much higher....all I really seen was a blinking red light on that craft going the same direction pretty fast....I didn't hear any sound from that one either. I am a pretty good illustrator\/ artist and I've sketched out what I seen, ill try to make an animation If I can. But thats about it....I do belive in angels and demons, that is, beings that exist in a different dimention or whatever. Just thought I'd throw that in. So yeah....CRAZY!!!

Appeared an off white light, like a car headlight color. The object continued moving across from west to east. As the object moved closer, the light string appeared to be a collection of lights spaced closely together, but a more amber color. They did not appear to be at a high altitude like a passing satellite would be, but rather at an altitude lower than an airliner would fly.\n\nAs the object was directly overhead, you could make out about 15-20 of these lights moving at a consistent speed. They were separated from each other, but not too far apart, about as far apart as a string of white Christmas lights are. They were bright; the light they emitted was about as bright as a jet's lights passing overhead and certainly more brighter than a star light. The light was amber in color, like a car's fog lights\/parking light. There was a silhouette surrounding the string of lights, I would describe it as a zeppelin\/blimp shape. It was similar in color to the night sky, although a little lighter to notice a contrast between the lights and the silhouette. It was clearly a continuous oval that surrounded the whole light string. Basing off the brightness of the lights and the definition of the surrounding silhouette shape, the object couldn't have been more than 10,000' above us. The object made it just a little more past being directly overhead towards the eastern sky, then rapidly faded away (about 3-5 seconds from being totally brilliant to disappearing) there was not a cloud in the sky that night. It was almost as if the lights just simply turned off and the object disappeared from view. No noise at all, just the lights and the silhouette surrounding the lights.\n\nIt definitely did not seem like just a string of passing satellites; they were emitting light like a car headlight in the distance and were more amber in color than white like a passing satellite, they seemed lower than orbit, and they were slower than a passing satellite. Also, every picture\/video I've seen of the starlinks showed so many satellites, like hundreds of them and a string of lights that stretched across the sky. These lights were not that many in quantity and not that long. I would have believed it was starlinks had it not a) been those characteristics I just described, and b) had it not simply faded into the night sky when there was zero clouds\/obstructions in the sky. The pictures I'm uploading don't do it justice, they did not appear as white as they do in the pictures, and they did not show the silhouette and the separation between the lights. The first darker picture was taken over the western sky and with an iPhone 10S without the night mode. One of the brighter pictures was taken again over the western sky, and the other was taken a little before it was directly overhead. Both of the brighter pictures were taken with an iPhone 11 with night mode.\n\nI'm sorry for wasting whoever's time with this if these are characteristics of starlinks and you rule it as such. Like I said, I would have believed it was starlinks, but those few characteristics and the fact that it faded into the sky. It probably was starlinks, but after doing research all night I still have a gut feeling that it was more than just starlinks. Sorry again if you rule these as the starlinks, I just have a feeling that they were something else hence why I'm doing this report. Thank you for your time.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":["https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/IMG_5894-0ef824bee50737bd48eed64f46c917a8.heic","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/IMG_5893-76d522ac248d7ba213d40e67ea5953d2.heic","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/IMG_8723-aae55193cb3b9076f8f8a2405f576ff6.jpg"]},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167571.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"10-12 evenly spaced lights appearing in northwest sky travelling southeast, fading out one light at a time.\n\nAt first appearance I thought it might be an airplane pulling a lit banner (appeared to be that heigth) but no noise.

I ask them what is that?\" My three friends then turned and looked and we were all stunned. I took out my phone immediately and began to film it. Unfortunately there was to much light coming from the city to get a good video of it. The orangish line began to slowly drift to the right and faded into a light green color. At the same time it was changing colors, an oval shape started to form. My friends and I could not believe our eyes. Approximately 20 to 30 seconds into the initial encounter, the greenish ring grew incredibly fast, almost as if it had gotten a lot closer to us. As it grew, I then noticed it started to dim and grew immensely brighter. There was almost an aura or force field around it. It dimmed down again and suddenly vanished into thin air like nothing was ever there. Like it went invisible or something. It didn't make a single sound the entire time. I am absolutely positive that this was NOT man-made. I initially thought it was a shooting star but moved entirely to slow.

The cluster was so large and close that it caught my eyes. I went inside to put a warmer hat on and jacket then rushed back outside at 9:51 Eastern standard time to see what I thought might be fireworks or possibly a meteor shower. I knew that this cluster was a unique occurrence because I have done this same thing almost every night for years and have never seen anything like this. I started to really focus on this cluster and realized that I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what I was looking at. The lights were coming collectively straight in the sky over my garage moving in the direction toward my house. The color was yellow and had a shimmer to it similar to a banner being dragged behind a airplane. A dull roaring became louder and louder as the lights passed over. I thought that maybe an airplane had decided to string up some lights on the back of a banner, however there were no airplane. The sound was so apparent that I looked to see if it were in a different spot because I knew something was making the sound but couldn\u2019t see what it was. I noticed I didn\u2019t have any air traffic I could see. That also struck me as odd because I see so many airplane\u2019s every night and I live about 15 minutes from the airport. I started to record the lights but couldn\u2019t get a good focus and my camera stopped recording. My phone then locked and froze. I\u2019ve never seen an error on my phone happening like this. It simply would not unlock or unfreeze for about a minute. When it did unlock and open I started recording again looking at my phone then back to the sky and I noticed the color was a little different on the screen. It seemed to take a yellow tint at first then became very white as the object passed over. The cluster was more stretched out than before but the alignment of the lights was so precise that it couldn\u2019t be a flag or banner with lights because it seemed to float across the sky. When the lights were first seen they were moving faster but once it came over it slowed down and looked like it formed a shape. As soon as I could get a better shot and focus on it the lights looked as if they just went behind a curtain and were all gone in the blink of an eye. I looked up thinking I was officially crazy and scratched my head about what I had just seen. I thought for a few minutes and wanted to look at the videos to compare. After some looking online a bit I came across the starlink satellite pictures and they looked alike but the more I reviewed all of my information something seemed off. Directly after the lights disappear I seen 4 airplanes come out of nowhere and fly over the same part of sky like they were looking for something. The rate of speed they moved across the sky was so much faster than the large lights I watched float over. I tracked the path of starlink and it doesn\u2019t seem to match the path of the lights in my recordings. I always look at the stars, the moon, the sky and listen to all the airplanes and helicopters at night for years. I\u2019ve lived in this house since 2007 and see all kinds of thinks in the sky but nothing comparable to this.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167585.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Bright ball of light appeared twice.

It was almost right over me, maybe a few degrees to the south. It started bouncing around and moving erratically. It appeared to have noticed I was looking at it and started moving all around to see if I really could see it or not. Well it had me spinning around in circles trying to follow its movement until it came really close right over the top of me.

It then moved north west and broke the line of sight, I walked up the alley until I could see it again and it came right back over the top of me.

I currently live in a rural part of Hungary with little to no light pollution so the stars and the rather frequently passing satellites are almost always easily visible. As I was taking in the interesting light conditions caused by the illumination of the moon, I spotted a faint light, what I initially suspected to be a satellite. It entered my sight of vision from the north west and it had a south-easterly heading. I normally would have dismissed it as a satellite as it mostly behaved like one; the speed seemed constant and it was heading on a straight trajectory. The only thing that made me maintain visual contact with it was that it randomly and abruptly flashed up (twice maybe 3 times) with a white light similar to what I could describe as camera flash. It wasn't plane strobe lights--I'm familiar with those--and it wasn't random due to cloud cover, as it was completely clear and all the starts around it were clearly visible. In addition to the few and random flashes, it also began to fade somewhat but then in a matter of seconds it would go back to its original brightness. All of this was still nothing out of the ordinary. The fading and the flashing I assumed could be the result of the satellite turning and reflecting the light of the sun and\/or the moon (sun was obviously not visible to me as it was 21:05 (GMT+2) +\/- 5 minutes). The fading I figured was the object getting slightly closer to where the moon was (thus the moon light overpowering the illumination from the sun in the back). However, I found the re-illumination a little strange, but still nothing out of the ordinary. The flashing I also attributed to the possible drone activity--due to the current situation in Ukraine there's frequent aerial military presence in the region with NATO drones monitoring the area (I regularly check adsbexchange for activity). Once again, until this point there was nothing I hadn't seen before. However, after its re-illumination, the object (I'm still having goosebumps as I'm typing this) all of a sudden (literally in a split second) accelerated while doing a half infinity symbol like loop and shot off back to where it came from with now a north-westerly heading. The acceleration and the loop-like movement happened simultaneously and in a fashion I had never witnessed before; there was no anticipation or build up of any kind--they were both instantaneous. As the object shot off to where it came from, it even left a small light flare like tail behind it (for a millisecond) similar to a tracer bullet. The acceleration with the loop like turn and the disappearance all happened in less then a second. Obviously, all of this happened without any sound so it could not have been a jet fighter (familiar with those too and they are not capable of such movement). It also wasn't a shooting star; I've seen plenty of those too and I have never seen them do a 180 turn. I couldn't believe what i had just witnessed. I then entered the house to tell a family member who in response also ran out to observer the sky. We continued to monitor the sky for a few minutes, hoping it would come back, but it obviously didn't. 10 to 15 minutes later, we went back inside, and that's when I messaged my brother about what I had seen (that's how I have the accurate time). I also checked adsbexchange to see if there was any military or drone activity in the area, but other than the usual commercial traffic (often quite busy) and a few military transport planes (US and German Military) there was nothing in the area. Even if there was, this was definitely not plane like performance. For the next hour or so, I continued to go out and check to see if I could spot something similar. I even grabbed a pair of binoculars. I observed the occasional air traffic and some common satellite movement, which I now understandably followed with more scrutiny, but for a while there was noting unusual. Then, at around 22:00+gmt (maybe +30min), a similarly satellite like object appeared from the north north west. The object was once again approaching silently with an average satellite like speed and a constant whitish glow. Once again, not unlike a common satellite. Except, this object began to slow down and eventually came to a full stop above me with a 5-10 degree deviation to the north north west from the Zenith. As it began to slow down, I once again alerted the same family member, who instantly ran out and witnessed the slowing of the object. The object then began to slowly shift back and forth, left and right, and doing little but observable adjustments in its movement. In the binoculars it seemed like a regular star accept it was slowly moving. The motion was not due to shifts in my movement (due to breathing, etc.) nor would I attribute it to the shake in the binoculars. The small movements were clearly visible by both me and the other observer. After about 5-10 minutes of no other action, a cloud cover crept in, at which point the object along with all other celestial objects were no longer observable. The rest of the night was overcast and so is the following day (4\/16\/2022). I couldn't take a photograph or record it on video as the light was too faint and little to be picked up on camera. The first observation happened unexpectedly and very quickly. I have no idea what this object was, but based on the physics of the first observation, this was definitely not an airplane.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":["https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/obj141620222105gmt2-837458b72ac5b15c0ee481c4e3e3d363.jpg","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/obj241620222230gmt2-63c5308561dbf67dfd7bc43a70750b3d.jpg"]},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167514.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Saw a disk with lights in sky\n\nI was travelling via bike and found the sky to be fascinating\u2026So I took a picture using my Iphone to post a picture and then only I discovered the disc in two of my pictures around same minutes..

After identifying several familiar stars in the clear part of the sky (Castor, Pollux, Procyon, Regulus), I happened to look directly overhead, and noticed to my surprise a very bright, pure white \u201cstar\u201d that shouldn\u2019t be there. It was at least as bright as Venus but directly overhead. I watched it to determine whether there was any motion, in case it was a satellite or airplane landing light, but there was no motion. After a few seconds (perhaps between 5 and 10 seconds), the light turned yellow and faded out. As it was fading, a second similar light suddenly appeared about 4\u00b0 to the southwest of the first one, remained on for a shorter time \u2013 also a few seconds \u2013 and then yellowed and faded out the same way. For a few more seconds, a tiny faint pinpoint of light was visible in each of the two locations, then they too faded out and nothing more was to be seen. I listened intently for a couple of minutes but there was absolutely no sound (and this was on a calm, quiet night) so the lights were not from helicopters or airplanes. In any case, the only way airplane landing lights could be seen from directly underneath would be if an airplane was in a vertical dive; and no navigation lights or other lights ever appeared. I got binoculars and probed the area but nothing further could be seen other than normal background stars; there were no clouds in that part of the sky at the time. I considered the possibility that the objects might have been meteors coming directly at me, but the description did not seem to fit: the lights were the wrong color for meteors (pure white before fading to yellow), there was no trail or apparent motion (as would be expected if meteors were coming almost toward me), they were much brighter than any normal meteor, and they remained visible (especially the first one) several times longer than a meteor takes to appear and then fade out.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167475.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"On tv show\n\nWatching street outlaws on discovery channel and it shots across the screen, maybe discovery added but it\u2019s obviously there","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167463.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Visit thier curious I think.\n\nSaw thier telescope, and it was me and my mom she remembers nothing but it was surgically invasive.

As we continued driving south, we realized during our approach this machine was remaining in place hovering about a thousand feet above. We discovered it was not moving as we slowed down while driving under it. We slowed down to a crawl to view this machine that had a very bright white light (aviation) underneath the center mass surrounded by red and green lights, but it had no noise. Its' size appeared to be about a size greater than a small private plane or helicopter, but why no noise? As we continued south, it abruptly disappeared from view - no remaining lights. We continued to drive slowly as an oncoming car slowed down too. I was perplexed whether it was a drone, why no noise? This area is also known to have many utility high power lines dissecting the countryside - wouldn't this be a navigation issue for this machine too? Plus it was much bigger than drones I have seen in my professional career - previously observed drones displayed at an international security conference, for convention attendees to view. Also observed a militarized drone assembly production at an international manufacturing facility, while there on business - these produced machines consumed a physical size footprint of a 20' X 20' room, in my opinion.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167442.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Saw the entire ufo tilt to the right and move further towards Lebanon\n\nA ufo formation in the sky- 3 lights in a line no matter how it moves in the shy moving further and visible tilt to the right where formation wasn\u2019t broken.

April 07,2022 . After periods of heavy showers the previous days the sky was very clear with large patches of blue sky with some broken clouds in between. In my open backyard I had been looking up at the sky for the usually common sight of incoming passenger planes approaching the Atlanta airport from a northerly direction starting their descent towards the west side of the airport. Surface winds from the west gusting 15-20 mph in my area and must have been strong enough for planes to use an eastern approach, so I didn't see or hear any passenger planes. While looking up straight over head I noticed at What I first perceived as a translucent balloon moving almost straight north. I then realized it was way above the clouds moving north fast enough that within 90 seconds it had moved halfway across the sky disappeared behind some clouds above. I still thought it could be a large almost clear weather balloon with a spherical shape. I went into my house around 2:25 pm and looked up the current jet stream maps for my part of west Georgia. Information from the current maps indicated the jet stream was moving in a northeasterly direction during or about 2:12 pm and at the approx. time of my sighting . Due to the fact it was definitely moving north instead of northeast , It seems unlikely to be a weather balloon caught in the jet stream.

As we leave the house, we routinely joke about looking at Venus to make sure we\u2019re going in the right direction. On this morning, we looked at Venus and noticed two smaller lights to the right, and slightly above Venus. Holding your fingers in a pinching position, with your thumb covering Venus and your forefinger covering the unknown lights, your fingers were about two inches apart, or a 2-inch distance from Venus. The two small round lights, smaller and not nearly as bright as Venus, were on a level horizontal plain, each light about 1\/2 inch apart. The light on the left was white and the light on the right was more of an ivory color. They didn't appear to move for the length of time they were being observed, which was approximately 10 minutes. At that time in the morning, no other stars were visible in the immediate area. As the sky became lighter with the rising sun, they didn\u2019t suddenly disappear but slowly became impossible to see due to the light pollution. Because Venus was so much brighter, it was still visable.\nThe next morning, (April 5, 2022) about the same time, we looked for these lights. The lights were still there but this time they were no longer parallel to the horizon but in a more vertical position. The lights appeared to be the same distance from Venus, and the same distance apart, but this time one light was in the 6 o\u2019clock position and the other in the 10 o\u2019clock position. They remained motionless. As the morning became lighter, the light pollution, made them impossible to continue to see.\nThe third morning (April 6, 2022) same time and place, the lights were no longer there and have not been seen since.\n\nToday, Apr 07, as I viewed and expanded the picture #1 on my iPhone, I noticed two very blurred lighted areas in the 2 O\u2019clock position from the original 2 unknown lights previously mentioned. They\u2019re indicated in the attached diagram. They also appear to be 2 round objects, one considerably larger than the other but both were very blurred, with a hazy area around both.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":["https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/Pic-1-44e3b6fcc108198c2b47af8f611f5fc8.jpg","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/Pic-2-310ebb0a220d4a2395ec759100504013.jpg","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/Pic-3-63bd88f98d06e695c7e7b5b5dd1287ca.jpg","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/diagram-64571fbd28b1815b905f04e7481754c4.docx"]},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167367.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Medium craft about 1000 ft above mountain top\n\nSaw this craft from my Semi truck.\nIt was hovering and hard to see through tree line uphill, but I got a good look at it for about 1 minute , I was looking uphill the craft was circular with yellow red green and blue lights on, it practically vanished out of sight once I made a sharp turn.

This is where the psychologically part comes in. I\u2019m 59 years old. never had I witnessed something like this. Not even on T.V. It was 11:00 pm. I was closing up the house getting ready to bed and I saw it from my kitchen window in the western sky.A very, very bright white light. I went outside on my driveway and observed it for several minutes. It went to the north and the back to the south several times. Seemingly not at a blind speed but faster than any aircraft that flies in these areas. It hovered for awhile and then it dawned on me to go in and get my cell phone to record, and I did. I filmed it for awhile then it burst into a orange circle of light rotating counter clockwise..pulsing all the while. It had in the center what seemed to be a more solid shape or object. It really isn\u2019t well defined. It did that for awhile before it went back to it\u2019s original shape. Hovered some more before it was joined by another and then the both disappeared over the tree tops. I wish not to send this video , however I am more than willing to share it in person.I\u2019m still a bit shaken about what transpired. If only I had some bit of clarification on what I truly saw, I would feel more open to share it withe world.

I couldn\u2019t believe it. It gave me chills as I saw it slowly disappear into the distance. It just faded out of sight. It was traveling East to West almost exactly because I used the compass on my phone afterwards, so I would know the direction that it was traveling for reporting. It was difficult to guesstimate the altitude but it seemed to be at about the same height or a little higher than Bays Mountain. It was traveling almost exactly perpendicular with Bays Mountain on the North side, heading in the direction of the Holston Army Ammunition Plant. It looked exactly like a triangular craft that I found online when I googled \u201cTriangular UAP\u201d right after it happened. It was moving fairly slow and disappeared out of view. The whole encounter was maybe 5-10 seconds. Absolutely incredible! This is the second triangular craft that I have seen in the area. About 5-6 years ago, I saw a black pyramid shaped craft during the daytime in this same area. Very close proximity. I did not report the first sighting, but I can tell you that it was exactly like the one that was following the USS Omaha about a year ago. When I saw the footage on TV, I was floored because it is exactly what I saw, except I saw mine in broad daylight. I have heard rumor that bombs are stored in the mountain at the Holston Army Ammunition plant, which is part of Bays Mountain AND the exact direction that this craft was moving towards.

At first I didn't think much about it, but, sometimes orbs & ghastly-extraterrestrials come out of them & sometimes they Light-Up & move, & the Dog started behaving weird, looking at the floor like a pup looks at a toy-car, ears going from one side to the other, & I seen a Ghastly-Extraterrestrial Appear, Sticking Its Head Out of a Small-Odd-Triangle-Shape In-the-Floor, &, It said something mean to my dog, got my dog growling at it, & the dog started biting at it, & it laughed at the dog & disappeared, but not the Triangle. I got Attacked-by the Extraterrestrials, & then started talking to them. I can hear them & communicate with them. They are talkative, & I have learned a lot of cool new stuff now from Interviewing Them & The Space-System. I did an Investigation & Found-Out This-Information: The Extraterrestrials are Not From This Space-Environment, They were Sent-By Their Corrupt-Creator, Czar. They are Immortal*, & I Figured-Out how. Also learned where Hitler came-from, why there were Extraterrestrials in the World-Wars & Vietnam, what happened to Hitler, why he is crazy. It's this Czar Character, It Attacked Our Space-Environment & destroyed Spacial-Real-Estate & many Planet-Surfaces & Is Trying to Destroy Us. I Figured-Out How-To Utilize This Space-System-Over-Ride-Thing to Catch\/Soul-Process The Extraterrestrial-Czar from Where he Dies & Can Prove It. The Over-Ride has him pissed, he lost ability to Process-his-Soul, & Lost Ability to Portal & Got Stuck, Is Stuck in a Cock-Pit in something called an ExtraExhistiential-Space-Ocean. This Czar Character made a Mistake: he sent the Extraterrestrials here, told them to attack, kill & enslave us, but didn't mean to pay, & they overheard him talking about killing them & destroying this Space-Environment when he was done. They Turned Against him & chose 'The-Quantum-God-Space-System' & he Opposes This Space-System. He got in-trouble with the Space-System & Got Stuck. He thought he was gonna win a fight with me & has lost. The Space-System is Who's Responsible for all the Telepathy & Saying-to-Apply-Settings-Stuff & Odd-New-Space-Environment-Workings. If You are Good At Your Job, you know something is attacking us from Space, it is because I caught this Extraterrestrial. I Found-Out How-To Do Everything. I have all the Instructions for How-To-Access & Utilize The-Space-System & Get Space-Environment-Access-Maps & How-To-Create-&-Hack-Open Ships-&-Portals & How Space Works & How to Materialize\/Manifest Stuff. I Found-Out the Extraterrestrials are everywhere*, because of how Czar created & sent them here, we are Outnumbered, but I currently have most of them Stuck onboard the Ships They Are On, & they don't mean to fight anymore, but do want help, are willing to forfeit ships for Study & Research. They don't know it yet, but they are full of potential, & i know it*. They have Lazor-Guns & Plasma-Shooters. I have Notes on the Interviews. They've attacked many people. They Soul-Project. I know how to get on & off-board their Ships, but, i don't think they're into getting hurt. I Figured-Out How-To Portal-To Czar, Their-Creator, To Kill him. We do that & gain control of the Situation again, gain control of the attacking ships in our orbit & around us, gain better info. I have photographed & video-recorded some more recent evidence. The Guy who's house this has been happening in is Dangerous, is under control by Czar alot without knowing, & absolutely won't talk about it. He's a bit mean, I could use some help with this. I believe The-Extraterrestrials are Ready to Come-Out In-Public, but are Scared, &, yeah, they do have bodies, & I got them to chill out a bit on the possessing-people. Can somebody please come help me with the Extraterrestrial-Invasion i am dealing with? It is what has been causing the Time-Restart-Problem. I found out exactly how that works Too. In one of the pics you see an extension-cord-end with a Ghost sitting on Top & a Small Red Ghastly-Ship Flying next to it. In one you see the Mark that appeared on my arm, & in 3 I caught the Extraterrestrials On Camera, got lots of pics. Figured-Out how to push them out of my eye & photograph them in my glasses. They can Shrink & Expand Their Ghost-Size. I have a video of them sticking their heads out of the Ghastly-Triangles & doing stuff, but your Web-Page won't let me load it. If you look around your own house, you'll find they are everywhere, but, I have all the answers, info, & cooperation from them, you likely won't get it without me. They are Telepathic. The Ships can be heard like EVP on Background-Noise & likely can be translated easily with good ghost-hunting equipment. I know how to hack the Ships of the Extraterrestrials Open & Get to Their Physical Selves. There are Many Different Species of Them, because each batch is made different. They have black-outfits.

They were a soft amber color, and at first I assumed they were planets or something like that. But the thing that made me pick up my phone to record it was the formation of the first set of lights and the way they just seemed to sit in the sky so effortlessly. It's hard to describe why they struck me as possibly being something other than something that could be explained, but i just got this strange feeling from them. Years ago, I had another experience w a strange sighting. My ex husband and I noticed a strange bright white (I can't remember if it blinked red or green, but i think it def blinked different colors) but it appeared out of nowhere, hovered extremely low for it to be a plane, and stayed in one place. He and I looked at each other in disbelief of what we were seeing, and in just the time of a glance- it was no where to be seen. We both knew what we saw wasn't anything that could be explained. My uncle also claimed to see a similar light that suddenly disappeared at the end of the same street. Of course everyone made light of the matter, so we dropped it and never talked about it again. So naturally, this time I was going to get what I was seeing on camera so I could prove what i was saying. And another strange thing is I got that same weird feeling I had gotten years earlier. So I start to record it and realize it would be difficult to show what I was seeing from the side of the road I was on. So I go to turn around immediately and before I could get turned- they were gone! There was 1 that was faint but it was gone shortly thereafter. I was shaking and done so for i know an hour after I got home. I posted the videos in hopes of someone giving me an explanation so i could calm down, but I looked up every suggestion mentioned and none of them looked like what I saw.

I was out walking, and saw a black triangle with 2 red and 2 green flashing lights hovering over the area of the 29Palms Marine Base, and thought it to be a vertical landing F35 or other fighter aircraft. I ran inside my home, got the telescope, and focused it... other neighbors out walking had seen the craft and grown concerned as well. The lights were VERY bright, brighter than any drone lights I've ever seen, and brighter than any lights I've seen on an aircraft, and I've lived near airports and flight paths my entire life. The triangle was hovering above the airspace that airplanes use when coming in for a landing at the local Palm Springs Airport, and appeared to be about 15-20,000 feet in altitude. After hovering for about 10 minutes, a commercial airplane came into the normal landing pattern for the Palm Springs airport and passed by the object with what looked like several miles of distance between them, and about 20 seconds later the triangle abruptly dropped at an extremely fast speed, almost to the ground (it was no longer visible to me as a house was in the way). My spouse and several shocked neighbors saw it too. I then went back inside and Googled every drone and jet fighter VTOL picture and video I could find, and even thought it may be an Osprey aircraft, but nothing looks like what I saw.\n\nFor background, my spouse and I both have 20\/10 vision, and are very skeptical about UFO sightings. But this was absolutely terrifying. We've never seen anything like this.

I turned to go back to the house and looked up at the stars in the clear sky. Above my house, about 750-1,000 ft. in the air I saw a circular object hovering. The object had one red light on the side and a blue\/green light directly opposite. Both lights were flashing simultaneously. I immediately ruled out this object as a helicopter, because there was no noise whatsoever. I assumed that this object was a drone. I wondered why a drone would be flying over my house and who would be flying it. I wondered if the police operated drones and then realized that in any case this would have to be.a very large drone. If my estimation of its altitude is correct, the object may have been about 10-15 ft. in diameter. Aside from the flashing lights being visible, I could also make out the vague circular shape which was lighter than the night sky. After about 30 seconds of staring a the object, suddenly the lights went out. The object was still there. I could still see it hovering with no movement. It remained there without lights for about another 5 seconds, then it began a slow widening arc. I watched it curve slowly West, South and then as drifted to the Southeast it blended into the night sky. I waited for it to return or for the lights to appear again, but nothing happened, so I went inside. The attached image is an image of my house which I photoshopped to make it look like night and to show the relative size and where the object appeared.\n\nAt this time of night I had not yet gone to bed, was not dreaming, or experiencing any kind of hallucination.

The leading tip of the chevron was an angle of about 45 degrees. It had sharp angles and shimmered around the edges, kind of like if I were looking at it through a hazy mirage. It trailed the shimmering for about half to full width of the object. It was hard to make out because it closely matched the color of the night sky, but it was just a bit darker. Totally silent.\n\nMy son claimed to see 5-6 dim orange-ish lights on the underside. I didn\u2019t see any lights, although his eyes are sharper than mine. He also said he saw a cube-shaped object closely trailing the chevron, almost a part of it. I don't recall that, but I do recall there was a roiled air or vapor shimmering trailing the object closely, like a ripple. It may have contained another object shape close to the chevron or otherwise account for what my son reported.\n\nWe watched the object pass over us and across the Saigon river moving north. It moved in a straight line and uniform modest speed. It faded out on the other side of the river. I couldn't tell if the light angle changed such that we lost sight of it, or if it just faded and disappeared. About 30 seconds total viewing time.\n\nI have no idea how far up it was because there was no reference point. My gut told me it was not close to the ground, up at least a few hundred meters and probably more. If that\u2019s true it was massive. The wingspan (if you can call it that lol) was about the width of 3-4 fingers held together at arm's length. Much larger than I am accustomed to seeing jetliners.\n\nReally no clue what this was, other than highly unlikely it can be explained by weather phenomena. I earned my private pilot's license and enjoy amateur sky-watching, so am familiar with aircraft. This was like nothing I've ever seen.

Look at that!\u201d\n\nIt took me a moment to make it out, but distinctly against the night sky there was a dark gray \u201cV\u201d chevron shape to the south moving north towards us, pointy end leading. To the southeast of Orion. The object was hard to spot because it closely matched the color of the night sky, but it was just a bit darker. Once we made it out it was quite clear though. Totally silent.\n\nThe leading tip of the chevron had an angle of about 90 degrees. The rear of each arm of the V cut off perpendicular to its direction. All parts had a defined shape and sharp angles.\n\nIt shimmered around the front, side and trailing edges, kind of like if I were looking it through a hazy mirage like light being refracted differently immediately around it.

This effect trailed the object for about half to full width of the object, like a wake in water.\n\nI\u2019ll try to describe in more detail the shimmering, roiling ripple effect around and behind the object because it was so odd. Maybe the closest thing is the bow ripple and roiling water in the wake of a ship, but that's not quite right. It gave me a distinct impression of light being refracted differently in the ripple, like looking at a mirage or the way faraway objects refract when looking through hot air over a hot road in summer, or the way an object refracts when looking at it on the bottom of a pool. This effect was only immediately around the leading edges and trailing the object, not present on the body of the object. It appeared around leading edges like a ripple, rolled around the outside of the object and trailed like a roiling turbulent wake that quickly dissipated.\n\nMy son claimed to see fewer than 10 dim pinpoint orange-ish lights on the underside in the outline of the V. I didn\u2019t see any lights, although his eyes are sharper than mine. He also said he saw a cube-shaped object closely trailing the chevron, maybe a part of it.

I couldn't tell if the light angle changed such that we lost sight of it, or if it just faded and disappeared. About 30 seconds total viewing time.\n\nI have no idea how far up it was because there was no reference point. My gut told me it was not close to the ground, up at least a few hundred meters and probably more. If that\u2019s true it was big. The wingspan (if you can call it that lol) was about the width of 3 fingers held together at arm's length. Much larger than I am accustomed to seeing jetliners.\n\nReally no clue what this was, other than highly unlikely it can be explained by weather phenomena. I earned my private pilot's license and enjoy amateur sky-watching. I am familiar with aircraft and things in the sky. This was like nothing I've ever seen.\n\nI've attached sketches my son and I made independently after viewing the object. His is on the left, mine right. His shows placement of lights on the V and the cube-like object trailing the V. I also attached a photo I found online that looks very similar to the object we saw, except that our object was darker than the sky and the ends of the boomerang didn't taper but ended in sharp angles.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167207.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"I saw a bright light hovering real slow\n\nI was laying down in bed i saw a bright light i pull my phone and i started to record and on the im not sure what a saw in details but it disappeared and a few minutes later it came back more close im not really sure if it was a different\nOne the second time was more bright and closer","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167180.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Saw it out of my cabin window before bed.

The lights would go in and out of view, and as we were watching and attempting to identify them, we kept spotting more. Up to seven appeared in the sky at the same time, all hovering around each other in formations, while not seeming to be moving in any one particular predetermined direction. The lights blinked as they moved, in some of the photos we gathered they seemed to be circular, while in others they seemed to have a triangle shape, though they were too unnaturally high up in the air for the camera to capture the shape definitively. We called a friend of mine who was driving in the area, to see if she had seen anything; she also spotted these lights and described them in the same way. Twice we saw one of the white lights briefly blink to the color red before disappearing.

I do this all the time, and when there is a nice breeze and cool Vegas weather, I tend to linger around just enjoying the beautiful view of the mountains in the foreground. So before smoking I was just enjoying this atypically cool and breezy afternoon when I noticed something shoot up really fast from inside the large tsunami drainage canal right outside my window.\n\nIt was unmistakable. I'm a critical thinker who's highly skeptical by nature.

I saw it just sitting there for a split second, when I stared directly at it, then it immediately rose from behind the treeline blocking the lower view of the drain canal and quickly shot up (I can see over the treeline). This was unmistakably glowing and bright. It shot straight up, extremely fast, until I lost sight of it after it pushed through the overcast layer above me. Since I'm on a higher floor I had a perfect, undeniable straight look at it rise from the bottom and then shoot straight up.\n\nI don't know what it was. It could be literally anything unexplainable from ball lightning to interdimensional demons Alex Jones is such a fan of. I'm not here to say I know what it was, but I can say what it wasn't.

He\/she probably feels alone and isolated, tortured, and under a constant threat of death.\n\nI myself have been in contact with them daily for about 3.5 years, Since 10\/29\/2018 to be exact. They \u201cactivated the beam of light\u201d and made a \u201ccross border run\u201d and \u201cmass arrested\u201d innocent people and their children in their homes and have gang stalked them ever since. Like I said before, Q is a massive Alien Gray gang stalking, terrorist, operation both foreign and domestic. FISA was the start, the act of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance. The ones that are knowingly contacted are under the constant threat of being killed and they do indeed have the means to do that and make it look natural. That\u2019s what they do.\n\nI also have multiple videos of them and it is exactly the same crafts seen in his video has reported and is seen on his video.\n\nHere\u2019s the newest one from me, watch it closely for movement, pause and movement again. It\u2019s brief but worth a look.

Citizens are preverbal sitting ducks. Everything must be something else, a more plausible explanation, which is exactly what the Grays use and expect. Plausible deniability is the ultimate hiding spot.\n\nThey are attacking human beings on the ground. Average American citizens are being tortured and gang stalked daily by Alien Grays. Chronic Pain, \u201cMysterious\u201d ilnesses, and much much worse. They have no idea an enemy is overhead. Families are being separated, people are being isolated, people are being maimed and worse.\n\nHere again, they presented themselves as reptilian but I do not believe that to be the case. There is no official government site to report this information to and that\u2019s a damn shame. Government oversight, missing the ball, or any other excuses for not giving an outlet for real insight, there is no safety whatsoever for your family or yourself.\n\nThe US government will have no other choice but to declassify this information unless they would like to be culpable in aiding and abetting the enemy of the United States, it\u2019s citizens, and it\u2019s allies. It\u2019s as simple as that. The Grays are cold blooded murderers and will torture and mock their victims at the same time. They must be dealt with or this Country will be driven to the depths of hell and \u201cthey\u2019ll never see it coming\u201d.\n\nThis isn\u2019t going to end well for anyone withholding information. We are actively engaged in an alien invasion or infiltration, whichever you prefer to call it, and the people, entire families, are ((unknowingly)) paying the price. Telepathy is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI want to debunk a few things in case it becomes an issue because they do project all sorts of disinformation but I learned there communications and they can not bullshit me. There are no reptilians walking the earth in human form, it\u2019s utter nonsense. Some of the news stories are devastating to read knowing what I know about them. They will gladly lead Putin and the US into a nuclear war and it all of it using Plausible Deniability while being attached to and guiding Vladimir Putin AND President Joe Biden.\n\nAlien Grays are linking themselves neurologically to humans and \u201cacting\u201d through them. \u201cActing\u201d AG\u2019s.

The light from the preceding flash was still dimming as each new flash started. Center light was constant. The center light may have been a different color than the point lights, but I'm having a hard time remembering that detail. My recollection was that the center light was warm white and that the point lights were somewhat cooler white. Flight path was straight west and relatively slow for an aircraft at its apparent altitude, speed was consistent. The object was apparently relatively low, but well above the highest points of Elysian Park (so, at least 1000 feet, and I was never directly below it). The object was already east of me when I saw it, flying over the area of Dodger Stadium, due east (approx.) toward the San Bernardino mountains. I watched for approx. 2 minutes until it passed behind a nearby hill, obstructing my view. There was no sound that I could associate with the craft. I did not have a clear reference for the size of the craft, and only the lights were clearly visible. I'm not a trained aircraft observer, but I am not familiar with an aircraft with this lighting configuration. This is a busy area for commercial aircraft of all varieties and there were other aircraft in the sky at the same time. At virtually any given time, I can see an airliner, a private plane, or a helicopter in the sky from this neighborhood, and I had observed at least one airline jet in the minutes prior. Those clearly fly at a much higher altitude. The object I sighted was flying at more of a helicopter altitude (again, apparently). A helicopter at that location, in these viewing conditions (ambient sound level) would have been clearly audible. If the object was a plane at a higher altitude than it appeared, It may not have been audible under normal conditions. I often watch the sky when I walk at night. I have never seen or reported a UFO prior to this report. I did not take photos. It occurred to me that at that distance and lighting contrast they would not have captured much\u2014at the time it did not occur to me to make a report.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167119.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Two Huge Silver sparkling Spinning spheres coming toward us in the sky\n\nDriving through the Sierra Nevada Mountains \/ Carson Pass, we saw Two Huge Silver sparkling Spinning spheres flying above Kirkwood Ski mountains.

I came across this website by happenstance as I was looking at 1970s photos of new jersey etc. What I first witnessed was seen by 7 of us in the summer of 1984 or 85. I lived in a mobile home community(Cedar Crest) in Vineland New Jersey.It was 10'oclock at night and a bunch of us just got done playing team Frisbee. We all saw a low flying black object with an illuminated windshield where you could make out the sillouttes of beings inside( chest up to heads) and it glided so slowly and projected colored light to the ground red,green,blue and would fade to each .The 2 people who were with us were in their 40s and parents to the 1 girl and he (father) said it was a blimp. I'm 19 at the time and my future husband both said it can't be. Its not advertising anything and the shape was a pointed front end that both sides went back to form a flat end. A trapezoid if you will.When it got close we all waved hello and watched it slowly go over and kept going south until covered by tree line. I will never forget it. The 2nd sighting was where I live now. August 29,2018 3:23 am, my dog woke me to go out. Windows were open and I heard what sounded like a helicopter in the distance.I rolled over and back to sleep. 20 mns later my dog woke me to go as now he meant business. I got up and went to the bathroom and heard the same him as prior. I went to the window and saw a stationary bell shaped craft just sitting g in the eastern sky.I put Geddy on his leash and went outside. I noted the time as 3:25 am as flip phone in pocket indicated( unfortunately no camera on my primitive phone.it had lights on either side. The left side the lights flowed up and down the right side they stayed on. It had a distinct hum of an idoling engine. I watched for 23 minutes. Then it slowly went up on an angle to the north. Stopped and stayed there for 5mns and then back the way it came but kept going. I called news\/ police stations if anyone reported anything. I checked media for the next week. Nothing. Third sighting was October 2019. It was close to sunset and I was walking south with my dog along the farm field. The sky was clear and blue. As I was looking this football shaped nickel colored craft popped in from out of nowhere. It stayed for 1 second and skipped like a rock across water to the right horizontally. I have shared my UFO experiences. Thank you.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167039.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Seen two sphere shaped objects in the sky that definitely weren\u2019t a plane, jet or helicopter. This is the third time we have seen this.\n\nI emailed back on February 11, 2022 about witnessing an odd sphere shaped object in the sky for a second time that came from the same direction and went the same direction both times and both times the duration of seeing it go across the sky was 5 minutes. Now today March 10, 2022 at 8:06 A.M. I was outside with my two children waiting for their school bus when we noticed the same sphere shaped object coming towards our direction but this time there was another sphere shaped object behind it kind of like making a hovering movement. The second one even disappears and reappears in the sky twice. Both sphere shaped objects even have like a haze around them. This time we even noticed at one point when it was coming closer to our direction of where we were standing in our driveway that the first sphere shaped object had blue lights around it like in a circle. Both sphere shaped objects went in the same direction and the duration of seeing both in the sky lasted for 5 minutes like the first two sightings. Out of the 13 years that I have lived in this area I have never seen anything like this until that first sighting on October 14, 2021 at 6:09 P. M. and then the second sighting on February 11,2022 at 8:05 A.M. We have airplanes, helicopters and jets fly quite a bit over our direction so I have seen what those look like in the sky and what we have seen those three times is definitely not airplanes, helicopters or jets. All three sightings my two children were outside with me at our house and just like me are very curious as to what this is that we have seen now three times within 5 months.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":["https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/DB5A3C7D-0D5B-45AF-8458-70326E5A1DE0-6de3ca1579e6ca49ed393518464464d4.jpeg","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/011760D5-7B55-44D8-BD32-BEADF04E2FEC-d52738bc9b8a7309b7cf86c0b14822cf.jpeg"]},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167053.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"The shape of a circle with twinkling white lights that was rotating\n\nThe shape of a circle with flashing white lights that was spinning at medium speed at almost high altitude.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167048.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"We saw the actual ufo after she spotted a light and caught it on video.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e texted me that she saw something abnormal.

I was very shocked as I had just seen the same thing the previous night, however this time the first one I saw was much closer over the highway so I could definitely tell this time it was very very large , square and blinking red and green. Yesterday when I saw the same thing while at home on my deck , it was very far away so I chalked it up to maybe being a special type of plane or some new technology that the government uses. This time I was so shocked I saw it again, I phoned my husband on speaker phone while I was driving to tell him what I was seeing. The craft was flying back and fourth over the highway. It then stopped in place , I could not find anywhere safe to pull over to take a picture or video as this highway is along the ocean. As I drove by that one and it disappeared farther up the highway by Ladysmith there was another large square craft that looked the same , blinking red and green. It almost scared me because I did not see the one from farther up fly to this spot. So I think it must have been another one. The highway wasn\u2019t very busy at this time of night but the few cars on the highway looked like they slowed down as well to take a look.

Out of my peripheral I noticed another smaller object to this objects left approaching in the same manner. Then there was a larger one that displayed the most beautiful brightest colors that never left it's location in the sky. It kind of just bobbed around up there. The others slowly in a floating manner proceeded to the water tower. In about an hour there was at least 5 orb like objects hovering over and around the water tower.

I looked to the North and noticed high above the power lines that go across the straight there were these three really bright lights. They were moving slowly or hovering and faintly looked like they were connected in a large v shape. There is an airport in Gig Harbor and I know that sometimes airplanes line up in their flight pattern can look like that from far away, but these lights were obviously the same height and distance. Also, airplanes are never flying in the proximity of the electrical wires. They were not moving fast like an airplane and were far enough apart that they were not wing lights on one plane. Whatever it was, was pretty big. Super weird! We only had a minute or so to observe the lights before our view was cut off.

I looked out and saw a large white glowing orb at what looked to be maybe 5-7 miles. As we studied it, it started moving on what looked like a collision course with us, and at co-altitude. It got about twice as bright during this time. We then asked ATC for a climb to 24k because we were worried it would collide with us. We received permission to climb and described the position to ATC as we were looking at it, but ATC said they had nothing visible at all on radar. After ATC said that, the craft seemed to drop quickly below the undercast cloud layer at 18k below us. We did not see it again after that.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167031.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Object was seen hovering motionless until we had stopped vehicle in road where it then began to proceed over us\n\nObject was seen hovering motionless until we had stopped vehicle in road where it then began to proceed almost directly above us very little sound could be heard and no recording flights were in the area.

It also would grow incredibly bright, fade, disappear and even strobe. In the video it was in the sky to the North, most likely over the Columbia river. It was moving at a speed and direction that would be impossible with our technology. It seemed to be between 100 feet and 2000 feet in elevation. Movements were very fluid and slow to lightning fast.

I believe I stopped at 22 S Hampton Rd. The objects passed just south of me, moving east. The first object started to fade. Fade as in moving in a straight line away from me. Not over the horizon.

I would first see a craft shaped like a boomerang way up in the sky and sometimes a bit lower in the sky. There is this large craft with many lights, rather large and then there are smaller ones with a distinctive shape and these crafts follow me everywhere I go, its like they know when I am going to leave my home because it would be waiting outside my home for me to come out. There were or sometimes would be many of these small aircrafts which tends to look like stars but is a bit different than a star. This here information is going to sound rather or a bit crazy but there are some type of shadow or light flickering people,, things or whatever they are that I see. They tend to follow me where ever I go and I believe they hear everything I say. I have encountered many problems from this entity, its like they are invisible but their shape is kind of seen even tho they are invisible. They roam through my house and would be in my car somehow. I have no clue what I am reporting about, all I know is there is always these aircrafts following me and it seems like they beam something down on my vehicle from the sky and there would be one to five shadows of them in my car. I know this sounds a bit far fetched but this shit is really happening around me. I have seen different type faces and in the beginning I saw a rather large being that had the face and eyes of an alien but I wasnt sure what I was seeing; all I know is, I am tired of being subjected by them they involve themselves in my everyday life and every time I leave my house they follow me. The whole thing puzzles me because there is also a helicopter involved somehow cause whenever I get to where I am going the helicopter show up and fly over my car during the day but at night is when the boomerang type aircrafts come out and follow me along with this kind of big craft with many lights follow me along with some other strange type crafts that are very bright lighted with an odd shape. I know this all sounds confusing, mind you it all is confusing for me and unbelievable! but this goes on in my everyday life from the minute I wake up to the time I fall asleep, which is very annoying and stressful. I'm not sure if Columbus, Ohio official have any inkling of what fly around in their skies at night, starting the minute dark hits and it is many of them. You never see them during the day but they always come out at night. I'm not joking or just making something up, this shit is really happening and I don't know what to do because it is targeting me on a constant basis and they never let up and never give me a break. This thing here that has been happening needs to be investigated although I believe they have many techniques to cover themselves to not get caught or even for someone to see them because they hear everything, see everything and know how to make themselves unknown. There is more to this report that I have to say but so far I don't think anyone would believe this, of what I'm reporting. Hell! I don't believe it, but its definitely been happening and at one point in the beginning of this turmoil I thought I was going to lose my mind because they hunted me daily. There are many things I can tell in this report but much of it is unbelievable, I say this to myself all the time. I want my privacy back and want this invasion to go away. I don't know who or what could help me but I am tired of it. I came to believe it is aliens when I first realized all the shadowy stuff and faces were coming from the sky. The things I have seen and encountered with this entity has not been nice,, not at all. I do not know who to turn to about this or in fact if anyone could stop this from happening because around me. The main thing is the following and harboring over where I live in the sky, beaming something or someone into my home where my daughter, husband and I live. It took me awhile to decide to do this report because I never thought anyone would believe me. I live in the Redwood Apartments in Pickerington Ohio off Refugee rd. To sum this all up, I do not know if these are aliens I am encountering or what but I'm needing to be free of it all. Columbus, Ohio need to check out their skies at night and find out what are these objects flying around their skies. I need to find out why they are hovering around me 24\/7. The main thing is who or what are they, where they come from etc.... and why are they after me all the time. This maybe something no one could ever solve or find out what they are and where they come from. There is more to this report but I am tired and know that they are right here watching me write this report to you all and I dont know, it may not even get to you because they are also hacked into my phones, computers and tv's, its like a nightmare.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167015.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Continuous contact with the forces of the universe\n\nThere was no noise in this.

It was like a car coming at my house, maybe 30 ft high over those trees, but the lights were a bit further apart (estimating 10-12 ft apart), and all I could see were those 2 orange lights that stayed evenly spaced. So I can't say if it was one object or two or how it was shaped? It dipped slightly and seemed headed for my house. But then it cleared the house so I ran to the front of the house to see if I could still see it. I could. It was heading North but was still very visible and further away. What was so unusual was the silence. Absolutely no noise as a plane would be making. No hum or buzz. And also unusual was how low it was flying.

However, as I stared at them, I realized it was something different and pulled my car over immediately to get out and take a look. What I saw were 5 softly glowing, silent orange lights in a random formation over the highway. Each light was slowly pulsating. It seemed as if they were just hovering there, but it also seemed like they were moving towards the Oakland Hills. The formation was random; a couple of them seemed quite near the highway.\n\nI drove my car over to the end of the pier, by the boats, to see if I could watch them further. By the time I got there, the lights were already closer to or directly above the Oakland Hills. I watched a couple of them sink behind the hills and the rest drift further east into the fog, where they disappeared. I kept watching, and noticed either 2 additional glowing orbs or the same 2 orbs that floated behind the hills earlier float back up from behind the hills before following the rest into the distance. I thought I saw one more as I went to my car, but I can't be sure. I couldn't take my eyes off the sky for a little while longer and just watched and watched, to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThis took place over the course of a half an hour, at night. I've lived in Oakland for years and I tend to watch the sky at night from my porch, so I have a good sense of the various lights that appear regularly in the night skies (e.g., helicopters, drones, airplanes). The site was strange enough for me to pull over, and then keep watching as long as I could. It gave me an eery feeling.\n\nThe only explanations I can think of are flares and paper lanterns, perhaps released from somewhere near or on the pier. The latter seems more likely, given the direction they all seemed to be going. It's conceivable that there was a group of people further down the pier or on one of the boats releasing paper lanterns.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167318.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Saw a metallic 1 foot thick disc hovering in the street. It made a loud noise, projected light onto the street\n\nI was awaken approximately at 1 AM by a sound which I mistook for a very loud car or street sweeper of some sort. My room faces the street in front of my house, giving me a good view of passing cars and anything else out there. Also parked in my front yard is a run-down Chevy S10 pickup truck, I will explain why this is relevant later.\n\nWhen I opened the curtains, I saw a 20 foot diameter 1 foot to 15 inch thick polished steel disc hovering in place in the street. The object had solid edges, flat like the rims of a coin, and in the bottom center of the object was a large bright light. It was projecting a beam of some sort down onto the street, which I could see was stirring up leaves and branches, causing some sort of wind to whip up.\n\nMy pet rabbit was also reacting to this, running around my room in a fit of panic, thumping and grunting unhappily. I'm assuming the sound the object made was disturbing her so. It was a deep, low hum, not unlike that of an electric transformer, and I could feel it resonate in my entire body. I don't claim to know how the next thing happened, or why, but the nearest I can describe it is... The object communicated with me telepathically. I could perceive spoken words, exact spoken words, as follows:\n\n\"It's okay. We're not going to hurt you, we're just taking some measurements. We will be gone soon.\"\n\nI remember feeling an odd sense of calmness despite seeing what was essentially a UFO in the street outside my house. I'm an aerospace and engineering enthusiast, but I'm no UFO nut, and while I have seen some strange aircraft in my time, I have never seen anything like this before or since. Nor do I believe in telepathy, mind control or any new-age stuff. Never the less, I could \"feel\" the UAP attempting to communicate a sense of safety to me. Evidently it worked, because rather than being startled like I normally would be, I scoffed in annoyance at the loud noise, covered my ears and went back to sleep.\n\nI woke up the next morning with my hands clasped firmly to my ears.\n\nI don't claim to know what I saw, but I saw some weird stuff. Moreover, the Chevy s10 pickup in the front yard, which has a broken tarped-over window on it, had had its tarp blown away by something. It had also been pelted with various objects, possibly pebbles and small stones, as the left side of the truck was scratched and dinged up when it hadn't been so a day earlier.\n\nAll I know is that I'm tired of this X-files Roswell crap, and I'd love some answers.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/166\/S166960.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Red and green lights hid the actual shape of craft\n\nWas walking dog when he suddenly startled and ran the length of 8ft lead jerking him backwards.

It is cold approximately 42\u00b0, the sky is clear with a good view of the galactic arm following civil twilight. The planets Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus were all visible. Pluto is there but not visible of course. Just following civil twilight I observed a star link train passing from west to east. My first observation!\nStarlink train faded into the shadow of the earth nearly directly overhead. I observed six satellites total during the evening. While tracking one satellite another crossed my view and I tracked it as well. I have observed three bolide meteorites. I have also observed the Andromeda galaxy.\n\nA puzzling observation is this.\nDirectly overhead and not far from the Andromeda galaxy I observed a blinking light. It appeared like any other star however it was not a dim flicker like observed by the affects of red shift, however it was a very clear on and off like blink. The interval appeared to be regular to the naked eye and over the time of approximately one minute appeared to consistently display the same brightness. The blinking light faded from view and several minutes later returned with the same interval and intensity. However after several seconds of darkness, the blink changed to pulse. The scale of the light appeared to intensify to a peek before diminishing to darkness and then cycled through again. The color was originally bright white but over time faded to a light orange.\n\nOver the course of time the position of the object relative to my position on the earth did not change suggesting a geosynchronous position above. The event lasted approximately forty-five minutes.\n\nI thought this to be a piece of space debris tumbling and reflecting light.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167253.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Took a phone picture out of window while driving on highway\n\nWife was driving home on interstate when we noticed the lights above our car approximately 1200 feet , I snapped a photo from my phone, when you zoom in the shape really stands out","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":["https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/713DF4C6-2C69-4D66-A9C4-F9496FBBAD81-26c46d941970b1386d2c94fb46f18965.jpeg"]},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167286.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Cylinder or tic tac sited\n\nI made a report on this sighting already.

I kept eyes on it and called my son to me, he was in a tree in yard shooting targets with bb gun. He came to me and asked \"what\" he could tell by tone of my voice it was something serious. I said \"what's that\" and pointed to object, he looked and his eyes got big, jaw dropped and said \"wtf is that\" I said something like I just wanted to make sure I was seeing what I was seeing. I asked him to tell me what he saw, to confirm to me what I was seeing. He said to hurry and take a picture, but didn't have phone on me and didn't want to miss at least seeing it for longer. After watching it for a minute, the object and a cloud next to it seemed to fade before our eyes not take off flying in any direction, which was also very weird. It was still light out and sky was perfectly clear and blue in area once object \"faded\" away, my son asked \"how did it do that\" like I would know. I been searching for a report of same thing before I said anything, when seen report from person in Elgin describing same thing but no lights I used that date, I know it was 1st week of Dec., was wanting to just confirm someone else's report. Being in a Chicago suburb and being very obvious in sky, I thought there would be many reports of this object. It had to be pretty big, there were a handful of planes that could be seen in both easterly and western sky and from my observation this cylinder was much bigger.

I thought we would wait to see another aircraft pass by the area where the object was situated and gauge the size and altitude of it.

At around 8:15pm, I just passed Olathe, Colorado and the Tiger Propane business when I saw a circular craft flying in the tree line near some farms in the area to the right of the highway.\n\nThe craft was metallic, a dull gray color. Not shiny but dull. It seemed a little bigger than a large suv. It was a perfect circle. It was flying slightly faster than my car and was only a few hundred feet off the ground. It came out of the tree line and I got a perfect look at it. It paralleled my car for a mile or two over a large crop area. It then sped up and got ahead of me about a quarter mile. It then shot across the highway in front of me and then completely disappeared on the other side of the highway. I had my cruise control set at 70mph at the time so the speed of the craft was interesting.\n\nWhen I passed the area of the highway where it crossed the highway the lights in my rear view mirrors became wavy. It was almost as though I was driving through an area where there was a disturbance in the air. That only lasted a few seconds and then I could easily see the lights behind me.\n\nAt first I thought it was a weather balloon but it did not move like a balloon. It also gained speed fast. Also it completely disappeared.

It was difficult to judge size, speed and distance due to a visual distortion in the air around the object, with what looked like the visible pressure wave that forms around an aircraft when it hits the speed of sound. However, there was no recognizable sound nor sonic boom, and the object appeared to be flying well below mach one speed. If it was small aircraft size, it was likely under 3000ft altitude, and moving at light aircraft speed. However, it may have been larger, higher up, and moving faster.

We have a fox that is very skittish and will rarely make any sort of contact with people. However, on 08\/07\/21 this fox tried to enter our home and sat outside our door until night fall. My mother also noticed this but we both dismissed this as just odd behavior. At 10:30pm my mother and I were getting ready for bed when I glanced out of my window to see if the fox was still seated by our front door. He was not there but when I looked over towards the gold mine that is across from our home I saw multiple circular lights in the sky coming towards our home. Our house is right behind Pikes Peak as well as NORAD and we have never seen anything such as this. I was able to film the lights as the hovered over us and I contacted the FAA the next day to see if there were any drones being flown that night or if there were any kind of experimental flights being done.

Why so early? My husband & I are truck drivers and we were stuck in Houston, TX during a historical deep freeze. We had just woken up to a frigid 12\u00b0 outside, and I snapped a few photos of the thick ice everywhere. Nobody could move all week. Highways were empty, stores closed, people froze to death:(\nWhat I cannot understand is why the first photo (sans light in the clouds) was taken at 06:22, and the photo WITH the light was timestamped 7 minutes later at 06:29. Also, I looked at the IMG numbers of the photo sequence on my phone, and there is a number missing in between these two photos, which means it was deleted.

However, I ve seen numerous Terrestrial beings\n\nHello, I'm a Truck Driver. My fiance and I had just had a baby on 6\/2020. As that year came to an end she really wasn't liking the brutal winter of North Indiana. Being that we had recently relocated there from GA. was very understandable. But, I couldn't just leave my job that I had just begun less than a year prior. So we made an agreement, I would allow her and the baby to relocate to Huntsville, AL and I would transfer down in the spring keeping the same job. It was a win win. Until one night as we spoke on face time, I sensed something wasn't quite right. She was a bit distant, and I would always have to repeat the question.Well it was 3am in the morning, maybe she's exhausted. Is what I said to myself until a shadow like fuzzy figure seemed to be crawling into my bed and climbed on top of her. I said hello like 3 times before she even answered back. At this point I'm like who the hell is that? Are you serious right now. She kept saying What? Who? What are you talking about? She turned the light on and walked around the room and said it better not be..... and stopped in mid-sentence as the phone seemed to drop and it sounded as if it was kissing and snorting like sound. I was so agitated at this time until I just hung up. I dropped load off in St.Louis and headed back to Indiana. She called and called but I wouldn't pick up for anything because I didn't want to have say anything that I would regret, regardless of what I was thinking. Now, the next night it hap I need again but it this time it was pulling her hair and it looked as if she was performing fellatio and seemingly unaware or very nonchalantly as if I wasn't asking \"What the hell are you doing\"\nShe would look back into the phone and say nothing, I'm not doing anything. I was so confused and upset amongst a million other emotions. Needless to say, when that weekend came, and I was going down to see what in the hell was going it seemed like it still was happening. Now I'm infuriated like this is so freakin disrespectful. To make a long story short, because I have a years worth. I was unable to see who it was because it was a Draconian Reptilian, now it's Grey's as well as other Dinosaurians, and insect Mantis looking ones as well. They literally live with her. I know this ad a fact, I have photo's, videos, and after recently striking one. They have had it out for my blood. I feel as if something is urinating on me at times. Spiderweb being spit in my face, and Bugs crawling a on me are just a few.\nI've been hospitalized here recently because it felt as if someone had a pair of grip players on my heart. This is because they know that I know of their presence. As well as I'm filing custody for my child because I\ndont think that her mother is able to shake herself out of the super. She's constantly getting manhandled and sexually assaulted on a daily, in front of thos kids. How do I know that you ask?, well her 5 year old told me, because she and her 6 year old daughters can see them as well. As a matter of fact the five year old is the one that told me where it was after I asked her who she was talking to. She pointed in a corner and I proceeded to punch in that direction. Not knowing that I actually was going to hit something. However, I did, and it squilled. Shocked...Yet equally amazed, I turned then said, \"This is just too damn much for me\". The crazy part about it all, is the fact that it was no compassion for me at all, as she comforted it by saying it's going to be ok. So yeah. Thats just one of the many. I now call them the Adam's Family. I Truly wish it was some way that You could fly out in order for me to let you see. I have a photo that I took and it seems as if they purposely did some form of hologram of such, or maybe it was a portal. But whatever it was, it definitely wasn't earth. I hope that we could speak soon, because as of now. I have no help, no one that will take this serious, except the hospital that's sending me these believable bills.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167177.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"aircraft show up at sundown and hover over us till sunup every night since jan,2021 through now! still going on sometimes as many as 20\n\nWell it started back in Jan, 2021 we started seeing lots of small drones every night going around in peoples backyards looking in windows and they were lit up too that went on for about a month and a half then they stopped then we started seeing these larger aircrafts showing up every night some times high up almost look like a star but you could tell they were not then alot of times they would come down real low and they would just hover over our area all night long and sometimes you could see a white beam of light shine down to the ground and there are as many as 15 or 20 you can count from just standing in one spot and sometimes they move around but mostly just hover in one spot but they can move fast to if they want and theres usually some kind of plane flying all around them? not sure if its ours or its with them? and when there here things get weird here on the ground! our animals get restless and seem scared and our cell phones start messing up and not letting you type or send messages and our computers act up and so do our tvs! and also when there here you can hear a steady light hissing or clicking noise all over inside and outside and everything gets weird! some nights are more intense but there here every night! and things on the ground are very strange??? ,dare i say maybe aliens??were not sure what they are but weve called police and they told us they dont have anything like drones and dont be ridiculous there is no such things as alien aircrafts!?? and if we called them for that again they could arrest us! lol so there no help! we left messages with k-gun nine news on your side to investigate but never heard back from them! these things dont seem to care if we see them or not and anybody thats around here at sundown can see them we dont want people to think were nuts lol so weve kind of left it there but its still going on every night a year and three months now! we just thought somebody should look into it and couldnt understand why nobody has?? or maybe they have? oh and also if you zoom in on them they look strange almost like some kind of animal in the sky very strange! in the begining back in january 2021 we thought we were being haunted and it was very scary then we started seeing the small drones everywhere? then after a while they stopped and these aircrafts started showing up! and like i said things were very weird down here on the ground ??? i just happened to run into this site tonight on the internet so i thought id give it a try!","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":["https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/alien-aircradt-blown-up-large-very-strange--513328149ffc1ca0541253daeb367766.jpg","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/20220221_201647-5ce952c6b3f3b5b5768b457a3f25b940.jpg","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/20211212_1747231-fb304afbaaf6bff9c212b02577113b9e.jpg","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/20211201_0033381-f3902a74f6156a9f067863b7ab9a1bff.jpg"]},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167509.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"I saw a false God over 200 ft tall .made of human souls\n\nCall me at 904-XXXXXXX.

Piks were of so low quality i could make em out my buddy couldn't he laughed more at me so i bought a camera , he bought a camera also but different kind then mine and we bought a night vision bushnell monocular witch could take videos and pics . Being breif we left beginning of may for work 4 hours away for few weeks and started having the sightings there too . that confirmed that this was not no surveillance program on me or nothing of the sort the logistics just didn't make sense . Middle that first week at work i got one of the triangle sightings on video at night 1 am tracking it by its light over a lake i started filming and lost the craft in the treeline when it popped up right in front of me . At this time i'm also getting lots of orbs on pictures at night when i try to take pics of it . After the video sighting few days after i try the night vision and the very first time i put it on over the lake i get a good 5 minute video of a big orb just hovering slightly moving in front of me . These sighting last from april 2019 tilll november 2019 . around september 2019 i finaly get good pictures of it on pics of the craft . i'd be averaging 4-5 nights a week in that time of seeing sightings . But November 2019 it all came to and abrupt end . Thats till end of june 2020 when i notice its back again . This time lasts from june 2020 till march of 2021 . march 2021 it seems to go away again but i would have couple of sightings during this time . I gathered alot of pics and video during this and i got the best ones on computer for evidence , which i had to do to prove to my friend and to myself that i was sane and not loosing my mind . Alot of different sightings in those dates way too many too explain all here lets just say to me its morphing or changing ... i think orbs , lights in the woods , triangle crafts , some of the plane sightings at nights , lights on the sea that appear to be boats are all one of the same . i have a youtube channel with 12-13 short videos . i would gather my pics videos for few weeks and make a video update on my channel so most of the better sightings and pics are there . i'll leave you the link https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCZD7UKu8vGgl0reKtAjNivA .","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":["https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/122614630_647059676180765_8765944209301875834_n-03c2f8e4c9a8ae17efa00c2ceb3d8872.jpg","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/122889110_2999870010114551_5365421582505787598_n-e53040002af459661d5a97cceb8f801c.jpg","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/127817390_435234134149625_5826762190120224699_n-4b13f8d8733e76416340fd8c4b2113e8.jpg"]},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167498.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"9 glowing globes crossed the sky from horizon to horizon in approximately 2 seconds.\n\nNine glowing globes shot across the sky at low altitude without making a sound.

My Granddaughter and I were followed in the car to the Coles supermarket and came after us in the Coles car park car park when we got out of the car. Yes, I do have witnesses, including two police officers and sent emails to others. But even though the cops saw these things follow them and saw what I saw one cop was in denial and the other cop said I don\u2019t know what they are, but both said I think it would be safer for you if you go inside the house and stay there and we will repot this to the proper authorities. My family refuse to acknowledge any of this and it is understandable that this would scare the hell out of any normal person. Well to the cops I guess I am some crazy senile old bag who was most probably high on something, and my daughter tells me stop letting my imagination run away with me, so welcome to my imagination. It has been over three years now and there has been too many to count in the night sky and around, for example one night I walked outside and was looking at the vacant lot next door and from out of the sky hundreds of these fairy lights of different colours came floating onto the ground it looked as though someone had put on a light show it was so beautiful and then as they hit the ground they vanished. I have learnt they don\u2019t vanish they are still there you just can\u2019t see them. They have been different colours, different sizes, they make no sounds, some change shape, they do go into people\u2019s homes, they will approach me if I let them know that they are there, so I don\u2019t tend t to look up when I go out into the yard anymore or the little fairy light type things start coming down after me. What I have discovered over time is that they travel faster than the speed of light, can be invisible to the human eye, dogs can see them, so they can be seen by inferred, camera\u2019s slow them down, and capture more. They turn up to the same position every night and there\u2019s a lot of them most of them look like planets or stars from a distance, I have taken photos of a couple of ships there is the one I have included but the recent one I still have not downloaded as I find it stuffs them up. It is hard to tell the size of things on my camera when it comes to space, I am no photographer and as for size with the things I have seen close to the ground they are not big enough to carry a being in them. The biggest one that I had chat with outside the bathroom window was round looked like the glass lens of a camera with thin lines on it as it spun around it seemed thick and was wider than my shoulders higher than my head I never paid much attention I was to busy questioning it and was worried about it getting to close to me when I failed to realize that another one had snuck up behind and had been sitting there for some time I guess and frightened the hell out of me. these are the ones that hang out over the airport Mr orange I call the main one. Had this thought go through my head at the time that this one didn\u2019t seem so happy that the other one was getting too friendly was it maybe because, it was its superior officer, girlfriend or Mrs or boyfriend, who knows, but I learned most of them travel in pairs. While I was sleeping, I have been woken to a blue light hovering above my head, when I sat up it disappeared into the wall, well I thought it did back then, discovered otherwise since. Now realise the dam thing was still in the room made itself invisible. Since these things have appeared things have been happing to my family, our healthy Shepard died the vet said there was nothing wrong with him, I ended up in hospital with my brain swollen and now suffer with high blood pressure and migraines my Granddaughter broke her femur and has been ill and my daughter have been ill I don\u2019t know who, what where, these things come from, but someone better give me an answer pretty dam soon because I am dam worried. I don\u2019t like my home and my privacy being invaded; I don\u2019t give a dam who they bloody are. I am no crazy loon, and these are real photos, just want to get this stuff sorted, I am worried, others might not care about their family and country, but I care about mine. If I don't get answers soon I will start taking these things out I dont care who owns them.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167520.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Multiple flying objects Emanating MULTIPLE COLOR LIGHTS (red white green blue) GOLD!\n\nIt was May 5th 2018 ,Me and my friend candice were bouta walk to the store and it was exactly 7:45 we were headed there for some cigarettes and drinks so anyways as were walking mind you the store is only three blocks away so anyways its cinco de mayo everyone is outside having a good time musics playing and other things so as were walking my vision began to get blurry so i looked to my friend and said damn i need to get my eyes checked so as i wiped my eyes she looks up and says \u201clook friend its a shooting star and i said oh shit it but this wasnt your ordinary shooting star it began to fall but then stop in mid air and just hover .So then this thing started Emanate light and the light began to get brighter and brighter stairing it was very beautiful but then the lights began to flash red white blue and green but as it did those things it would follow us as we walked so when we noticed this we would stop to see if we were tripping but we weren\u2019t it was following us now we made it almost to the store i tried to stop these two guys i knew to ask them if they could see what we saw but it was like they walked straight threw us like a time portal or something i dont know it was very weird so i proceeded twice more too get their attention and finaly i was able to get them to look up and i asked i said the you see that hovering to the far right in the sky they laugh and say man i dont see nothing you trippin i said dude it\u2019s literally right there how can you not see it so they walk off we get in the store get what we went for and walked out so when i looked up again theres now a bigger object hovering but this time its beaming a bright orangish gold light so i pulled my phone out to recored but i noticed the time now says 9:02pm so i tell my friend im like why is the clock saying 9:02 and we left the house at 7:45 again its takes literally no less than 10 minutes to walk to the store as were walking this thing is following us and im like let make sure i record this now at this point i definitely know its not a plane it was odly shaped and it had like a transparent dark outline as it could blend in with the sky im sorry im going all over the place but so much had happened so as were walking back i tell my friend hey im goong to ask your sons do they see what we see shes like ok so now were a bit frantik cause its like no one that we would attempt to ask could they see this thing in the sky its like they couldn\u2019t hear or see us i mean literally walking straight through us im jumping up and down infront of them yelling and screaming waving my hands i mean nothing was working nothing and so many people were outside i just couldn\u2019t understand what was going on but anyways back to the story we finally made it back to her house at this point im so anxious i didn\u2019t get to see what time it was or was really worried about the time i just wanted to see if her kids can see what we were seeing so i called them outside and i said look can you guys see that and they said yes surprisingly so now her son proceeded to record on his phone so this THING START TO SHINE SOME TYPE OF BRIGHT BEEMING LIGHT TWOARDS US AND EACH TIME IT MESSED WITH OUR VISION EVEN MESSING WITH THE RESOLUTION AND QUALITY OF THE VIDEO ON THE PHONE THE FIRST FEW VIDEOS HAVE SOME TYPE OF WEIRD RADIATION NOISE LIKE SCREECHING IT HURTS YOUR EARS WHEN U HERE IT .

I noticed the first initial light just turn on as like a lamp one solid orangeish light as seen in the video. i then stared noticing other ones faintly flashing around it after a few minutes i never thought much when i seen the first one just sitting but when i seen the others appearing I pulled out my phone to film. I witnessed with my eyes in detail the events pictured in the videos so i know that whats seen is accurate to what was happening no camera flares or shines etc. pitch black in country side. So as i continued watching and filming the once solid light became hollow like a ring and i started to notice other ones sort of splitting out of it like when cells multiply and they would appear all in different brightness's going either up or down but making crescent shapes as they appear. That continued for maybe 2-3 minutes from the initial light i seen appear in the sky as it it was turned on and it sat still then progressed into what you see in the video and explained. After it was done it formed a waning crescent moon and remained in the sky the entire night till morning and i could see the moon still in the sky during say time the next day. The color of the seen lights was a orange color similar to headlights until it changed into the moon is was a very bright moon with the normal color you see in the moon at night when its bright. There were no aircraft seen flying during the report landing or taking off as there is a small private airport a few kilometres to the North of where the video was taken. Sky was mostly clear very few clouds no rain, no wind no recent storms. I did have a weird feeling that i felt almost being watched or observed when i started recording and before i was recording only small lights were flashing around it similar to seen in the first clip solid balls not ring like also pictured later. I've never been a big UFO person but to this day that was one of the many strange things ive seen living out in the country where i can better observe the sky and the only thing I've been able to record to date. I also witnessed only via camera a second UFO seen appearing as almost blue\/white energy looking thing I've never really known how to describe it i noticed it on camera while taking photos of the moon after it finished and was just sitting as the moon and when i zoomed in i seen what appeared to be \"energy\" as it looked like it was flowing or moving kinda like electricity and it was one strong line going horizontally slightly tiled and above was lighter lines in 2 spiked patterns that also seemed to flow with energy. i was able to observe this for about 10 minutes before it just kinda faded out slowly till it was gone it never moved any directs on made lights or changed in any was i didn't notice how it came to appear i just seen it on camera. The \"moon\" remained all night with no further changes after its initial ones. The videos were posted to my instagram account several years ago im trying to get the originals or save them in a better manner if i am able to i will be these are same footage just screen recorded from my page as i couldnt download the videos as files.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":["https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/screen-capture-important-2-March-3rd-07429e9054e9204e557030a927f4651f.webm","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/screen-capture-important-1-March-3rd-df8ed3ed5cae5458d1c9dacd896579fb.webm"]},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167021.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Red circular object circling the moon at a fast speed\n\nMy friend and I were working the nightshift in a commercial building.

We both took many photos and videos which we still have in our cell phones.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":["https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/Sky-109-2c46ab118e35123b3f8fe255f8f28818.png","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/Sky-110-80de96dab2394ae6cb937404618b5672.png","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/Sky-111-d4b1d84b0bb35bba28e611df04506b37.png","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/Sky-112-8caddf49815d3b05f730dc1ac9fccc99.png","https:\/\/nuforc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/wpforms\/624-c824613929464448a7e062112379f845\/Sky-114-e755c7f4c6e845d866f90e2b426a4166.png"]},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167160.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"About 3 feet off the ground, hovering, not moving and absolutely no sound at all.

He had grabbed a cigarette and we sat on the chairs outside glancing up at the stars, it was a clear warm night. He was an avid listener to coast to coast AM so we would always joke about if\/when we were gonna see something. We were chatting about plans and I said alright I'm out bye! As I turned and walked he said my name as to get my attention. When I turned back to him thats when I saw it...\n\nA orange orb hovering between us and the house across the back yard, distance to house would be under 50 yards and typical 1 or 2 story height. The orb was close though with a size of maybe beach ball or yoga ball, its honestly hard to tell because of what it did and the shock of seeing it but it seemed to be above the house but nearer to us. They or whatever it was knew we were there. I know this because of the ending of sighting which proves this was not a reflection or hallucination. It was real not \"earthly\" but very real. It lasted at most a minute or two, at first it was hovering still like a mini sun almost. Then it did a weird jellyfish or dead leaf motion, in and out, getting slightly bigger then slightly smaller and with each pulse in and out it went up maybe 10ish feet. It did that roughly 5 times until the last one it shot off upward and instantly disappeared, we both turned to each other, thinking we just saw something very weird.\n\nHere is the freaky part... I took steps out into yard to fully look for it and saw nothing. No less than a minute later we hear this noise from off in the distance, louder and louder until a single military fighter jet, no lights of any kind came screaming down in an obvious dive chase from higher up. I've seen blue angels and others do tricks and show off at norfolk\/va beach multiple times, very familiar with the sounds they make. This was a jet looking for that orb, which was obviously toying with him when it decided to come show off to us or say hello, who knows. All I know is we were in shock and out of nowhere that jet probably high up in the sky saw it again and dive chased it not knowing we had front row seats to the whole thing.

It then started moving off slowly for a couple seconds then shot away faster than anything I have ever seen. I know this story sounds crazy but I swear on my life it is absolutely true. I was not drunk or high. I do not, and have not, ever suffered from any mental illness or hallucinations. I know what I saw. I know it wasn't made on this planet. The question of whether we are alone in the universe is an unanswered question for many, but not for me. I know it happened a long time ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/167\/S167438.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"Very fast moving light that rapidly changed direction while I was watching it.\n\nI was taking the trash out at night and a light in the sky caught my attention.

We noticed this for about 2 or 3 minutes. Then, the object emitted colored (bluish-green, and pinkish-red) beams of light that went out from the object and crossed the highway out toward the west and south.

My friend who witnessed with me is now a Marine and we talk about this sighting a lot, still. We were sitting near the sidewalk indian style on the driveway talking. Suddenly a very bright light lite the area and made it hard to even see his face 3 feet away. At that very moment both of us looked to the ground around us and noticed a perfect circle of light about 5 feet in diameter on the ground around us, absolutely dead still, with a perfect edge to it. Within a few seconds, this light wiggled slightly, and started to slowly move away and across the neighbors yard. We stood up and watched as it went along about 50 feet and stopped. This circle of light on the ground was from a beam of light coming from above, we noticed. This is where it gets very strange. The light starting from the ground started to recede into the sky. You could see the circle part that was on the ground move upward slowly. Like there was a bottom to the light!!! We watched as it went all the way up into a vehicle of some type, almost looked like a 4 foot halogen tube light in the sky... Like the color of a modern standard led tube bulb. We watched in awe, asking each other what we are looking at. It stayed there stationary for about 5 minutes. All of a sudden we heard and seen it leave at an amazing speed, directly away from us. Literally sounded like a light saber turning on... I know that sounds funny, but that's the only way to describe it. This is also the only time we heard anything. It zipped away, or possibly disappeared, but seemed like it moved away. That's how quickly it went from us. At that very same time 2 street lights went out. That not strange I guess but it was perfect timing. I still dream about this night on at least a monthly basis. What still gets me is the unmoving light around us, and the way it started to move.

Gilbert was abducted on 1\/31\/1993, from a hotel in Sisters, OR. She was taken onboard a ship by benevolent beings, surgical procedures were done on her body, during this time Joy felt like these beings were her family. She was comforted by them through the process. They declared her \"fully activated\", took her to a window of the ship and she became fully awakened. This experience shattered everything she thought she knew to be true about who she was and her life. Due to her training in meditation and esoteric studies, she was able to integrate this experience and continue her relationship with these benevolent and loving beings. She went to UFO conventions and told her story, and also did many public talks about her relationships with these beings. This women is my beloved spiritual teacher, and her book (info below) documents this whole experience. Joy is a very articulate, educated, and credible woman who grew up in Seattle, WA\n\nI think that NOW is time that humans normalize our relationship with our star family and the Galactic Federation.

No noise or lights, but it was only 100-300 ft off the ground so we couldn\u2019t see the underside.

I could clearly see the multi-colored lights of orange, yellow, etc\n\n\"Green Skies\"\n\nThere are many things in the sky, but only a few can be recognized for what they are not. Of the many stories I could tell you I want to recount one event in particular.\n\nIt had been a long time hobby of mine to search the skies for things that were different and unexpected. I had invested in many different kinds of equipment including telescopes, computers with punch cards and manual switches. One piece of equipment that I had not specifically bought for my hobby turned out to be not only the best alarm but also the most reliable way to tell I was about to see strange objects in the sky.\n\nIt was a particularly quiet night with fair skies during the winter of \"72\". I had given up on seeing any UFOs on this particular night and decided to retire for a good night's rest. It was about 1:00 AM and the only sound was that of the frogs croaking outside my quiet neighborhood. As I approached the TV to turn it off. I heard the familiar \"Doda loop\" sound from channel 2 that always announced the presence of the UFO formations that came up almost nightly from the Southwest and veered off toward the east.\n\nRealizing that this was unusually late for them that are, by some 4 to 5 hours I hesitated until I heard the unmistakable sound again from the television. As I went outside by way of the back door to view the sky from the usual place in the back yard, I felt the stillness and silence of the night in my sparsely populated area. There were exactly two houses on the block. Mine on the right near the street entrance and my neighbors on the left at the end of the block, about two hundred yards away. We had probably only seen each other twice in the two years that I had lived there.\n\nUpon seeing nothing in the skies, I reasoned that the TV signal was a false alarm even though that seemed unusual. Back inside, I went toward the television again with the Idea of turning it off to go to bed. The signal was there again as if the TV was toying with me. Feeling that it was just another false alarm I went outside by way of the front door, which was much closer than the back door. It was my intention to just check it out in case and then return inside.\n\nI went outside and stood on the front stoop, concrete slab about 6 feet by 8 feet and one step down. As I looked toward the southwest skies I could not see the now familiar formations of UFOs that the nearby air force base claimed they could never see on radar. My wife being a reporter for the major newspaper in the east and a stringer for the local community paper gave her contacts a call that we had hoped would be helpful. They never were as it allowed her to speak with those she might not have otherwise spoken to but no information was ever forthcoming.\n\nAs I stared at the sky wondering why my TV was giving false readings all of a sudden after being so dependable for months, I suddenly felt that I was being watched. I could feel it all over my body as if there was a gel sliding around me. I violently spun around and looked up behind me where I felt something. There it was. A circular UFO with the lights at the bottom as the one my wife had seen some six or seven years before.\n\nShe and about twenty other people including police officers had watch for more that twenty minutes as a UFO hovered between my house and the neighbors house at about 200 feet off the ground. That had happened some 80 miles away from where we now lived.\n\nAs I looked up, I could see that this UFO was about 200 Yards away at an angle of about 50 degrees. I could clearly see the multi-colored lights of orange, yellow, green and blue on the bottom that appeared to be rotating. The upper portion of the craft seemed to have a large contoured window much like the Autos of the 90's, only much larger. There seemed to be an incandescent illumination in what appeared to be a cockpit with a clearly visible human shaped shadow sitting at the window of what I presumed were the controls. The craft was about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. I was frozen for about three seconds just looking then at the instant that panic over took me. It was that exact fear that happens only once in a lifetime. Suddenly as I turned and peered up the light in the \"cockpit\" went out. The UFO had been stationary, motionless until that time.\n\nWhat happened next is beyond any explanation or realistic logic. Being familiar with the sounds of WWWII planes, the sounds of the props on those planes is unmistakable. However, this was the seventies and except for the daytime sounds of the light planes from the nearby Lakeland Airport, which were more like the buzz of toy planes, there were never sounds of light planes at 1:00 AM in that area. As the light in the interior of the UFO went off the sound of a WWII prop fighter emanated from the place where the UFO had been. I can remember thinking in the middle of my fear, \"Oh sure I\u2019m suppose to believe you're a plane...you picked the wrong plane. They don't sound like that anymore\".\n\nAs I made a dash for the front door only a few feet away. I felt like I would have been contacted if I hadn't run but in all of the years of wishing that I could be, I knew this was the wrong one. I could feel it. I couldn't imagine of all of the sounds of modern jets, why would they choose a sound of a WWWII plane. I must admit, for a split second I almost fell for it. I was a second thought away from being puzzled into confusion. That might have frozen me there long enough. For what I don't know but this was the one time that it really wasn't meant to happen!\n\nThere have been many other incidents, but this one in particular is the one that got away...or is some being on some far off place telling the story of me, the one that got away.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null},{"Link":"http:\/\/www.nuforc.org\/webreports\/reports\/166\/S166990.html","Datetime":"6\/25\/59 18:00","City":"Seaford, Long Island","State":"NY","Country":"USA","Shape":"Disk","Duration":"3-4 minutes","Summary":"huge circular craft, had a dome with red lights at bottom ; flying at level of top of a telephone pole, turned 90 degrees in an instant\n\nThe sighting occurred in a suburban development consisting of 60 by 100 ft plots.

I cannot tell in feet how large this object was, but it was considerably larger than my cousin's house. I cannot adequately describe how slowly this object moved as it skimmed the roof and disappeared, still moving north at treetop level. Due to tree cover, we could not see what happened after this.","Posted":"4\/22\/22","Images":null}]
